# Instructions on how to use this tool

## 1. Setup:

* To use this tool, run the server.js provided and click the localhost link it provides. 
* This assumes you have node.js installed on your device.

## 2. Adding nodes/movies to the graph:

* Click in an empty space to add a new node/movie. 
* Adding nodes/movies will make them static in the graph. 
* Once you add a new node, the previous node added will move with the others. 
* You can edit your node/movie at any time.
  
## 3. Connecting nodes/movies to each other:
 
* Click a node and drag your mouse to another node to connect them. 
* You cannot connect a node to itself.

## 4. Search Bar:

* The provided search bar lets you search for any movies/nodes attributes, such as a movie with a rank of your choice, a movie name, a movie's ID, genre, director name or writer name.
* Once you provided an attribute to search, the movies/nodes that meet the criteria will expand in size and change color for better visualization.

## 5. Modify Node/Movie attributes:

* By clicking on a node/movie, you will be given an option to modify any attributes of the node/movie you selected. 
* After you type what attribute you want to edit, you will be prompted to type in that attributes replacement.

## 6. Delete Node/Movie and Edges:

* As, you may have seen already, by clicking a node/movie you are also given the option to disconnect or delete a node/movie. 
* By typing the name of the movie you want to disconnect the
node/movie from, that movie will be disconnected from the node/movie you clicked.
* Finally, you can only delete nodes/movies that are completely disconnected. 
* So, you will not be able to delete nodes/movies that are connected to another node/movie.

## 7. Change Node/Movie Label Display:

* The drop-down menu will allow you to select what label you want to display for the nodes/movies. 
* The options are movie ID, movie name, genre/s, or director name/s.

## 8. Largest Connected Component:

* The "Largest" button at the top will filter out the largest connected component. 
* You can edit it the same way as described in the previous instructions.
* The "Normal" button will revert to the normal display and all the changes done in the largest connected component will be reflected in the normal display as well.

## 9. Changing Graph Layout:

* The "Change Layout" button will alter the layout display.

## 10. Compute statistics:

* The "Compute statistics" button will display the Average Node Degree, Number of Connected Components, Graph Density, Graph Diameter and the Average Path Length of the current graph.
